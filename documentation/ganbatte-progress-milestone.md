# GANBATTE PROGRESS & DRIVER GEOLOCATION MILESTONE

---

## Checkpoint Summary

This milestone documents the implementation of a live job progress bar and real-time driver geolocation for the Ganbatte app. The following outlines the key changes, technical details, and how the system works end-to-end.

---

## 1. Progress Bar with Live GPS Tracking

- The job progress bar now includes a "Start" node, followed by "Pickup" and "Dropoff" nodes for single-leg jobs.
- The progress bar is only shown when the job status is "active" or "currently driving".
- The progress bar updates in real time based on the driver's current GPS location.

---

## 2. Driver Geolocation: How It Works

### a. Driver Location Updates
- The driver's device (browser) uses the Geolocation API to get the current latitude and longitude.
- The driver's location is sent to the backend via the `/api/updateDriverLocation` endpoint, which stores the latest coordinates in the `driver_locations` table (columns: `job_id`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `updated_at`).

### b. Fetching Driver Location for Progress
- The customer/staff view fetches the latest driver location from a new endpoint `/api/getDriverLocation?jobId=...` (to be implemented if not present).
- The endpoint returns `{ latitude, longitude }` for the most recent location update for the given job.

### c. Progress Calculation
- The frontend calculates the driver's proximity to the pickup and dropoff points using the Haversine formula (distance between two lat/lng points).
- If the driver is within 100 meters of the pickup, the "Pickup" node is marked complete.
- If the driver is within 100 meters of the dropoff, the "Dropoff" node is marked complete.
- The "Start" node is always considered complete once the job is active.
- The progress bar visually updates as the driver moves.

## 3. Key Code Changes

### **SingleLegJobView.tsx**
- Added logic to fetch the driver's latest location on a timer (every 10 seconds).
- Added error handling for missing/invalid location data.
- Added a progress calculation effect that uses the driver's coordinates and job's pickup/dropoff coordinates.
- Updated the progress bar to show "Start", "Pickup", and "Dropoff" nodes, and to mark them as complete based on proximity.

### **API Endpoints**
- `/api/updateDriverLocation` (already present): Receives and stores driver GPS updates.
- `/api/getDriverLocation` (to be implemented): Returns the latest driver location for a job.

### **Database**
- `driver_locations` table: Stores the latest location for each job (`job_id`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `updated_at`).
- `jobs` table: Stores job details, including pickup/dropoff coordinates.

---

## 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

- Handles missing or invalid driver location gracefully (no crash, progress bar does not update).
- Handles missing coordinates on jobs (progress bar does not update).
- Ignores fetch errors and 404s from the location endpoint.

---

## Next Steps

- Implement `/api/getDriverLocation` if not present.
- Extend the same logic to multi-leg jobs if needed.
- Optionally, show the driver's live location on the map for customers/staff.
