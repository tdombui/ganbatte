# Sprint Summary - June 30, 2025

## 🎯 Sprint Overview
**Date:** June 30, 2025  
**Duration:** Single-day sprint  
**Focus:** Default Address System & UI/UX Improvements  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED & DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**

---

## 🚀 Major Features Implemented

### 1. **Default Address System**
**Problem:** Customers had to type their full address every time in chat, even for common references like "my shop" or "the shop".

**Solution:** 
- Added `default_address` column to customers table
- Updated profile page to include separate "Default Delivery Address" field
- Enhanced AI chat to automatically resolve address references
- Created API endpoint for fetching customer default addresses

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database migration: `006_add_default_address.sql`
- New API: `/api/getCustomerDefaultAddress`
- Enhanced `/api/parseJob` with address resolution logic
- Updated TypeScript types in `supabase/types.ts`
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging

**User Experience:**
- Customers can now say "deliver to my shop" and AI automatically uses their default address
- Clear distinction between billing address and default delivery address
- Seamless integration with existing chat flow

### 2. **Conditional Action Button Rendering**
**Problem:** Job management buttons (Start Job, Edit, etc.) were visible to all users, creating confusion for customers.

**Solution:**
- Implemented role-based conditional rendering
- Action buttons only visible to staff/admin users
- Customers see clean, read-only job views
- Maintained full functionality for authorized users

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added `useAuthContext` to job view components
- Implemented `isStaffOrAdmin` role checking
- Updated both `SingleLegJobView` and `MultiLegJobView`
- Conditional rendering for all management controls

### 3. **Redesigned Progress System**
**Problem:** Complex node-based progress bars were confusing and not intuitive.

**Solution:**
- Replaced complex node system with simple, clean progress bars
- Video game-style single progress bar with percentage
- Color-coded progress states (blue, green, yellow, purple)
- Smart progress calculation based on GPS location and job status

**Technical Implementation:**
- Completely redesigned `ProgressBar` component
- GPS-based progress calculation with haversine distance
- Status-aware progress updates
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Progress States:**
- `0%` - Job planned
- `10-25%` - En route to pickup
- `30%` - At pickup location
- `40%` - Loading items
- `50-75%` - Driving to dropoff
- `80%` - At dropoff location
- `100%` - Job completed

### 4. **Improved Layout & UX**
**Problem:** Job page headers were buried below progress bars, creating poor visual hierarchy.

**Solution:**
- Moved "Job Overview" headers to the top of both single and multi-leg job views
- Progress bars positioned below headers for better flow
- Cleaner, more professional appearance
- Better information hierarchy
